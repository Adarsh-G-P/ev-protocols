## CdrDimensionType *enum*

This enumeration contains allowed values for CdrDimensions, which are used to define dimensions of ChargingPeriods in
both `CDRs` and `Sessions`. Some of these values are not useful for `CDRs`, and SHALL therefor only be used in
`Sessions`, these are marked in the column: Session Only

:::note
OCPI makes it possible to provide SoC in the Session object. This information can be useful to show the current State of
Charge to an EV driver during charging. Implementers should be aware that SoC is only available at some DC Chargers.
Which is currently a small amount of the total amount of Charge Points. Of these DC Chargers, only a small percentage
currently provides SoC via OCPP to the CPO. Then there is also the question if SoC is allowed to be provided to
third-parties as it can be seen as privacy-sensitive information. So if an implementer wants to show SoC in, for example
an App, care should be taken, to make the App work without SoC, as this will probably not always be available.

## CdrLocation *class*

The *CdrLocation* class contains only the relevant information from the
[Location](/docs/ocpi/06-modules/03-locations/06-object-description.md#location-object) object that is needed in a CDR.

:::note
For the German Eichrecht, different solutions are used, all have (somewhat) different encodings. Below the table with
known implementations and the contact information for more information.

## SignedValue *class*

This class contains the signed and the plain/unsigned data. By decoding the data, the receiver can check if the content
has not been altered.

| Property    | Type                                                          | Card. | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| nature      | [CiString](/docs/ocpi/07-types/01-intro.md#cistring-type)(32) | 1     | Nature of the value, in other words, the event this value belongs to. Possible values at moment of writing: - Start (value at the start of the Session) - End (signed value at the end of the Session) - Intermediate (signed values take during the Session, after Start, before End) Others might be added later. |
| plain_data  | [string](/docs/ocpi/07-types/01-intro.md#string-type)(512)    | 1     | The un-encoded string of data. The format of the content depends on the EncodingMethod field.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
