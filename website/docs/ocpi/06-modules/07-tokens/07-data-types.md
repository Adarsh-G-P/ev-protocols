## EnergyContract *class*

Information about a energy contract that belongs to a Token so a driver could use his/her own energy contract when
charging at a Charge Point.

| evse_uids   | [CiString](/ocpi/07-types/01-intro.md#cistring-type)(36) | \*    | Unique identifiers for EVSEs within the CPO's platform for the EVSE within the given location. |

## TokenType *enum*

| Value       | Description                                                                                                                     |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| AD_HOC_USER | One time use Token ID generated by a server (or App.) The eMSP uses this to bind a Session to a customer, probably an app user. |
| APP_USER    | Token ID generated by a server (or App.) to identify a user of an App. The same user uses the same Token for every Session.     |
| OTHER       | Other type of token                                                                                                             |
| RFID        | RFID Token                                                                                                                      |

:::note
The eMSP is RECOMMENDED to push Tokens with type: `AD_HOC_USER` or `APP_USER` with `whitelist` set to `NEVER`.
Whitelists are very useful for RFID type Tokens, but the `AD_HOC_USER`/`APP_USER` Tokens are used to start Sessions from
an App etc. so whitelisting them has no advantages.

## WhitelistType *enum*

Defines when authorization of a Token by the CPO is allowed.

The validity of a Token has no influence on this. If a Token is: `valid = false`, when the `whitelist` field requires
real-time authorization, the CPO SHALL do a [real-time
authorization](/ocpi/06-modules/07-tokens/04-flow-and-lifecycle.md#real-time-authorization), the state of the Token
might have changed.

| Value           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ALWAYS          | Token always has to be whitelisted, [realtime authorization](/ocpi/06-modules/07-tokens/04-flow-and-lifecycle.md#real-time-authorization) is not possible/allowed. CPO shall always allow any use of this Token.                                                                                                       |
| ALLOWED         | It is allowed to whitelist the token, [realtime authorization](/ocpi/06-modules/07-tokens/04-flow-and-lifecycle.md#real-time-authorization) is also allowed. The CPO may choose which version of authorization to use.                                                                                                 |
| ALLOWED_OFFLINE | In normal situations [realtime authorization](/ocpi/06-modules/07-tokens/04-flow-and-lifecycle.md#real-time-authorization) shall be used. But when the CPO cannot get a response from the eMSP (communication between CPO and eMSP is offline), the CPO shall allow this Token to be used.                             |
