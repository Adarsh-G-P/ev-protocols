Configuration Module

This module provides parties connected to a hub with the connection status of other parties that are connected to a hub
that they can communicate with. So, CPOs know which eMSP and other parties are online and vice versa.

Unlike the usual OCPI modules, this module is between eMSP/CPO and Hub instead of between eMSP and CPO.
