# Terminology and Definitions

## Abbreviations

* **OCPI** Open Charge Point Interface
* **CDR** Charge Detail Record
* **CPO** Charging Point Operator
* **eMSP** e-Mobility Service Provider

## Provider and Operator abbreviation

In this model, the provider and the operator play an important role. In order to target the right provider or operator,
they need to be known upfront, at least between the cooperating parties.

In several standards, an issuing authority is mentioned that will keep a central registry of known Providers and
Operators. At this moment, the following countries have an authority that keeps track of the known providers and
operators:

### The Netherlands

The Dutch foundation, named [eViolin](http://www.eviolin.nl) keeps the registry for The Netherlands.

* The list of operator IDs and provider IDs can be viewed on their website
[eViolin/Leden](http://www.eviolin.nl/index.php/leden/).

### Germany

The BDEW organisation keeps the registry for Germany in their general code number service
[bdew-codes.de](https://bdew-codes.de/).

* [Provider ID List](https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/ProviderIdList)
* [EVSE Operator ID List](https://bdew-codes.de/Codenumbers/EMobilityId/OperatorIdList)

### Austria

Austrian Mobile Power GmbH maintains a registry for Austria. This list is not publicly available. For more information

## Charging topology

The charging topology, as relevant to the eMSP, consists of three entities:

* _Connector_ is a specific socket or cable available for the EV to make use of.
* _EVSE_ is the part that controls the power supply to a single EV in a single session. An EVSE may provide multiple
connectors but only one of these can be active at the same time.
* _Location_ is a group of one or more EVSEs that belong together geographically or spatially.

A Location is typically the exact location of one or more EVSEs, but it can also be the entrance of a parking garage or
a gated community. It is up to the CPO to use whatever makes the most sense in a specific situation. Once arrived at the
location, any further instructions to reach the EVSE from the Location are stored in the EVSE object itself (such as the
floor number, visual identification or manual instructions).

## Variable names

In order to prevent issues with Capitals in variable names, the naming in JSON is not CamelCase but snake_case. All
variables are lowercase and include an underscore for a space.

## Cardinality

When defining the cardinality of a field, the following symbols are used during the document:

| Symbol | Description                     | Type       |
|--------|---------------------------------|------------|
| ?      | An optional object.             | Object     |
| 1      | Required object.                | Object     |
| \*     | A list of zero or more objects. | \[Object\] |
| \+     | A list of at least one object.  | \[Object\] |
