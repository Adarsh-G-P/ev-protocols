This repository contains a Docusaurus project that provides a translation and easier-to-navigate documentation of the
official documentation of the OCPI protocol. The documentation is strictly translated from the original asciidoc files
into markdown files, and flavored with the docusaurus options.

## What is OCPI?

The Open Charge Point Interface (OCPI) is an open, global standard for the communication between electric vehicle (EV)
charging stations and back-end systems. OCPI defines a set of RESTful APIs that allow charging stations to provide
information about their availability, status, and pricing, and to initiate and manage charging sessions.

## What is Docusaurus?

maintain documentation, including:

* A responsive design that looks great on any device
* A search engine that makes it easy to find the information you need
* A code editor that allows you to preview and edit your documentation files
* A built-in blog that allows you to share news and updates about your project
